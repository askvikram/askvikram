## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="1_introduction"></span>1. Introduction<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

In this article, weâ€™ll discuss SQL vs PL/SQL vs T-SQL about their key differences.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="2_sql"></span>2. SQL<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

SQL stands for *Structured Query Language*. It allows the user the access and manipulates the data in a *database*.

SQL is a common database language for all RDBMS products. It can execute, insert, update, delete and create queries against the database.

Moreover, SQL is an *ANSI standard* but still there are different versions of the SQL Language.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="3_plsql"></span>3. PL/SQL<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

PL/SQL stands for *Procedural Language extension* to SQL. It is literally used to build applications while SQL provides data for the applications created by Pl/SQL.

It is complex to understand but it is potentially more powerful. It does not interact with the database server.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="4_t-sql"></span>4. T-SQL<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

T-SQL stands for *Transact Query Language* it is also an extension of SQL. As many RDBMS Vendors have built their own RDBMS products they created a new Language by extending the SQL. It is wholly owned by *Microsoft*.

T-SQL is not just a database programming language having variables, functions, data definitions, data manipulation, loops and procedures but also having a string, mathematical, date and time and error checking.

<figure class="wp-block-table">| SQL | PL/SQL | T-SQL |
|---|---|---|
| Developed by Oracle | Developed by Oracle | Developed by Microsoft |
| Data oriented language | Application-oriented language | This is a procedural extension used by SQL |
| Execute as a single query | Execute as a whole block | Execute all commands in the server in a single go |
| Runs best with Oracle Database Server | Runs best with Oracle Database Server | Runs best with Microsoft Database Server. |
| Control structures are not available | Control Structures are available which includes conditional selection statement, loop statements and sequential control statements run differently for different values | Control structures are available |
| Declarative Language | Procedural language | Transactional language |
| Simply used to perform DML and DDL with using a single query at a time | Unlike SQL PL/SQL uses a block of codes helps to write the entire program block or procedures | T-SQL is a set of SQL statements which are being used to the transaction. |
