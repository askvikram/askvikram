## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="introduction"></span>Introduction<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

In this article, weâ€™ll discuss how to Use Group By Clause in Sql in Multiple Columns

**Group By Clause** is used in a *SELECT* statement often with *Aggregate Function*. It combines rows into groups on the basis of matching value in the columns mentioned. One row will be returned for each group.

**NOTE**: It is not always mandatory to use an aggregate function with a SELECT query. However, if we use an aggregate function it will eventually bring us the summary value of each group.

In a query a Group Clause should be placed *after* the **WHERE** Clause but *before* the **Order By** Clause.

#### 2.1. Syntax of Group by Clause in a SELECT Query Without Using Aggregate Functions

<div class="wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block">```
SELECT select_list 
FROM   table_name 
GROUP  BY column_name1;
```

</div>2.2. Syntax of Group By clause in a SELECT query with using Aggregate functions

<div class="wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block">```
SELECT   column1, 
         Function_name(column2) 
FROM     table_name 
WHERE    condition 
GROUP BY column1, 
         column2;
         
FUNCTION_NAME: name OF the FUNCTION used FOR example, sum() , avg().
TABLE_NAME: name OF the TABLE.
CONDITION: condition used.
```

Group By multiple column means to place all the rows having same values of both columns 1 and 2 in one group.

For instance, A shopkeeper wants to find out on a particular date how many products were sold. Then the query would look like

<div class="wp-block-codemirror-blocks-code-block code-block">```
SELECT Date_purchased,
       Products, 
       Sum(Product_purchased) AS "Total Items" 
FROM   Purchases 
GROUP  BY Products, 
          Date_purchased;
```

</div>In the above scenario, for a given date how many individual items have been sold out. Obviously, we are dividing the result and Sql returns the data exactly how we wanted it to return.
